# Placeholder Niagara systems

Niagara systems should be created in the Unreal Editor using the following asset paths:
- `/Game/VFX/Skills/NS_CastGlow`
- `/Game/VFX/Skills/NS_ImpactBurst`
- `/Game/VFX/Skills/NS_Trail`

These names are referenced by `SkillPresentationAssets.json` and the skill data table for temporary FX binding.
