# Skill presentation placeholders

This folder normally contains the Blueprint data asset `BP_BaseSkill` along with derived skill assets. Because this repository only tracks source content, placeholder metadata files are provided instead. Designers can create Blueprint DataAssets derived from `USkillPresentationData` using the asset paths listed in `SkillPresentationAssets.json`.

The `USkillPresentationData` class exposes the `PlayCastFX` and `PlayImpactFX` helpers to trigger Niagara and audio cues referenced by the data.
