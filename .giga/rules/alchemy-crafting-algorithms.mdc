# alchemy-crafting-algorithms

The alchemy system implements specialized crafting logic for creating pills and managing cauldron mechanics. Core algorithms include:

### Success Chance Calculation (Importance: 95)
Located in `Source/WuxiaMMO/Systems/AlchemySubsystem.cpp`
- Success probability determined by:
  - Base player alchemy skill level
  - Recipe difficulty rating
  - Quality/rarity of ingredients
  - Cauldron modifiers
  - Environmental effects

### Quality Multipliers (Importance: 90)
Located in `Source/WuxiaMMO/Data/FAlchemyModifier.h`
- Final quality score combines:
  - Individual ingredient quality values
  - Alchemy skill bonuses
  - Cauldron quality rating
  - Special technique modifiers

### Cauldron Durability System (Importance: 85)
Located in `Source/WuxiaMMO/Data/FCauldronData.h`
- Tracks cauldron condition
- Applies durability loss based on:
  - Recipe complexity
  - Ingredient reactivity
  - Critical failures
- Implements repair and maintenance mechanics

### Ingredient Combination Rules (Importance: 80)
Located in `Source/WuxiaMMO/Systems/AlchemySubsystem.h`
- Defines valid/invalid ingredient pairings
- Handles reactive ingredient combinations
- Calculates stability modifiers
- Determines special interaction effects
